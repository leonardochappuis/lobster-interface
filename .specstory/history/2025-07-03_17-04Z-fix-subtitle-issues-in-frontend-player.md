# Fix subtitle issues in frontend player (2025-07-03 17:04Z)

_**User**_

Can you please fix the issue with the subtitles? they are not working correct in the frontend player, the default subtitle selected in settings is not being applied and the subtitles are not being fetched and displayed properly. Take a look at @lobster.sh to see how it's usually fetched. I will have no cors issues in the frontend. See also @server.js to make any adjustments necessary and then fix the player in @MovieDetails.jsx and @TVDetails.jsx , which by the way share a lot of behavior so probably this could be in components
