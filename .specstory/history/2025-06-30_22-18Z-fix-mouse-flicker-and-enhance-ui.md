# Fix mouse flicker and enhance UI (2025-06-30 22:18Z)

_**User**_

seems like the mouse is flickering when I put my cursor on any movie card. like between pointer and cursor. can you fix? can you also maybe scan the whole project and do a cleanup. Them implement tailwind and daisyui on the frontend. make it beautiful and usable like you have a thousand years in UX experience. Dont forget that we are in tailwind5, so you should find out the new syntax and how to add daisyui
