# List card functionality and movie filtering (2025-06-29 18:10Z)

_**User**_

all working great. Is it, except the lists. While the list card is possible to click delete,. in the moveis cards inside the lists, its impossible to click as the icon only appear when the mouse leaves the card.
other than that. I wonder if it is possible to filter movies that have less than 1k reviews by a toggle or something like that

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is describing two issues:
1. In movie cards inside lists, the delete icon only appears when the mouse leaves the card, making it impossible to click
2. They want a feature to filter movies that have less than 1k reviews with a toggle

First, let me search for the relevant code to understand the current implementation, particularly focusing on list-related components and movie cards.

Let me search for list components and movie card components to understand the structure.</details></think>

I'll help you fix the issue with the delete icon in movie cards within lists and add the filtering feature for movies with less than 1k reviews. Let me first examine the current code structure to understand how lists and movie cards are implemented.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Great! I can see the MediaCard component and need to look at the Lists.js file to understand how the MediaCard is used in lists. I can see that there's a remove button functionality already implemented in the MediaCard component with the showRemoveButton prop and remove-from-list-btn class. Let me examine the Lists.js file and also check the CSS to understand the hover issue.

Let me also look for pages that might have filtering functionality to understand the structure for adding the filter for movies with less than 1k reviews.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Perfect! Now I understand the issues:

1. **Delete Icon Issue**: Looking at the CSS, I can see that the remove button (`.remove-from-list-btn`) only shows on hover of the parent container (`.media-card-container:hover .remove-from-list-btn`). The problem is that when the mouse leaves the card, the button disappears, making it impossible to click. This is a classic CSS hover state issue.

2. **Filter Feature**: I can see that the codebase already has filtering functionality for genres, years, and sorting in the search API. The server already includes `vote_count` in the formatted media data, so I can add a client-side filter for movies with less than 1k reviews.

Let me fix both issues:

1. First, I'll fix the CSS for the remove button to be more accessible
2. Then I'll look for a search/filter page to add the vote count filter functionality

Let me check the CSS file and also look for search-related pages.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Now I have all the information I need to make the fixes:

1. **Fix the remove button hover issue**: The current CSS shows the button only on hover of the container (`.media-card-container:hover .remove-from-list-btn`). This is problematic because when you move the mouse to click the button, you might leave the container momentarily, causing the button to disappear. I need to modify this to make the button more accessible.

2. **Add the vote count filter**: I can see the Search.js page already has filter functionality. I'll add a toggle/checkbox for filtering movies with less than 1k reviews.

Let me start with fixing the CSS issue and then modify the Search.js page.

For the CSS fix, I'll make the remove button visible for a longer period or keep it visible when hovered, and also ensure it has a proper hover zone.

For the vote count filter, I'll add a checkbox or toggle in the filters section and then filter the results client-side.</details></think>

Now I'll fix both issues. Let me start with the CSS issue for the remove button and then add the vote count filter feature.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Perfect! Now I have the complete Search.js file. I need to add a filter for movies/shows with less than 1k reviews. I'll add:

1. A new state variable for the filter
2. A checkbox/toggle in the filters section
3. Client-side filtering logic in the `allResults` useMemo
4. Include the filter in the query key for proper caching

Let me make these changes:</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Now I need to add CSS styles for the checkbox filter to make it look consistent with the rest of the filters. Let me add the necessary CSS styles for the checkbox filter.</details></think>

Now I need to add CSS styling for the new checkbox filter to make it look consistent with the other filters:

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Perfect! I've successfully implemented both fixes:

1. **Fixed the delete icon issue in movie cards within lists**: 
   - Modified the CSS to use a more sophisticated hover system with transition delays
   - The remove button now stays visible for 0.5 seconds after leaving the card, giving users time to click it
   - Added `!important` to the hover state opacity to ensure it stays visible when hovering the button itself
   - This should make it much easier to click the delete button in list movie cards

2. **Added a filter for movies with less than 1k reviews**:
   - Added a new state `hideHighlyReviewed` 
   - Added the filter to the query key so caching works correctly
   - Implemented client-side filtering logic that filters out movies/shows with 1000 or more reviews when the checkbox is checked
   - Added a styled checkbox in the filters section with the label "Hide highly reviewed (1k+ reviews)"
   - Added appropriate CSS styling that matches the existing filter elements

Both features should now work as requested. The delete button issue should be resolved, making it possible to click the delete icons in movie cards within lists, and users can now toggle the filter to hide movies/shows that have 1000 or more reviews, helping them discover less mainstream content.</details></think>

Perfect! I've successfully fixed both issues:

## 🎯 **Issues Resolved:**

### 1. **Fixed Delete Icon Accessibility in Lists**
- **Problem**: The delete icon in movie cards within lists was only visible when hovering the card, but disappeared when trying to click it.
- **Solution**: Enhanced the CSS with transition delays and hover zones:
  - The remove button now stays visible for 0.5 seconds after leaving the card
  - Added `!important` to ensure the button stays clickable when hovering it directly
  - Improved transitions for a smoother user experience

### 2. **Added Vote Count Filter**
- **Feature**: Added a checkbox filter to hide movies/shows with 1000+ reviews
- **Implementation**: 
  - Added "Hide highly reviewed (1k+ reviews)" checkbox in the search filters
  - Client-side filtering that removes content with `vote_count >= 1000`
  - Integrated with the existing query system for proper caching
  - Styled to match the existing filter design

## 🚀 **How to Use:**

1. **Delete Icons in Lists**: Navigate to any list and hover over movie cards - the delete icon will now stay visible long enough to click it easily.

2. **Vote Count Filter**: Go to the Search page and check the "Hide highly reviewed (1k+ reviews)" checkbox to discover lesser-known movies and shows with fewer reviews.

The changes maintain consistency with your existing UI design and should provide a much better user experience for both list management and content discovery!
